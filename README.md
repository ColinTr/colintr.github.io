A personal resume website built with React.js and bootstrap.

## 1. To start the website in development mode

> npm run start

This will start a web server locally on http://localhost:3000/ by default, where your modifications to the source code will update the page automatically.

## 2. To deploy the website updates :

> npm run deploy

This will build an optimized production build and deploy it to the <i>gh-pages</i> branch of your github-pages repository.

Don't forget to also commit and push your updates to the source code to another branch!
